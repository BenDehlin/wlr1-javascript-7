## What we did to set up
1. ran `npx create-react-app wlr1-javascript-7` and cd'd into it
2. ran `npm install axios react-router-dom`
3. built out components for demonstrating promises and error handling `./src/components/Promises`, `./src/components/AsyncAwait`, `./src/components/Throw`
4. set up routes for our 3 different components
5. set up a Header to route between the components

## What you need to do to follow notes
1. look through `./src/components/Promises` for an example of using a promise and handling the error that might occur
2. look through `./src/components/AsyncAwait` for an example of handling multiple promises using async/await
3. look through `./src/components/Throw` to see an example of throwing our own error
